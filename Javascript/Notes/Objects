Objects

-Really powerful data structures
-Also a javascript type
-Key value store?

var user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 34,
  hobby: "Soccer",
  isMarried: false
};

list[1]
"banana"
user.name
"John"
user.hobby
"Soccer"
user.age
34

-How to add properties to an object?

user.favouriteFood = "Ramen"
user.isMarried = true;

-Why is Array not a Javascript type but Object is?

An array is technically like this

var user = {
  0: name: "John",
  1: age: 34,
  2: hobby: "Soccer",
  3: isMarried: false
};

-What are objects used for?

A wizard in a game, health, MP, name etc

Arrays would be good for listing spells

var user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 34,
  hobby: "Soccer",
  isMarried: false
  spells: ["Fira", "Blizzaga"]
};

-Can I have an object in an array?

Yes, list of users for an app

var list = [
  {
    username: "Andy",
    password: "secret"
  },
  {
    username: "jess",
    password: "123"
  }
];

-Adding functions to objects

var user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 34,
  hobby: "Soccer",
  isMarried: false,
  spells: ["Fira", "Blizzaga"],
  shout: function(){
    console.log("AHHHH!");
  }
};

user.shout();
AHHHH!

-Console.log?
  Console is just an object! .log is a method it has
  console.info("hello");
    hello
  Methods are functions inside an object

-Can you make an empty object?

user2 = {};

-Can you make an empty array?

list2 = [];

-Empty object vs nullobject

var nullObj = null;

nullObj
null
